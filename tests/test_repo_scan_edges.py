"""
Repository Scanning Edge Case Test Suite for Algorithm Robustness

This test suite validates the robustness of core scoring algorithms under extreme
conditions, boundary cases, and malformed inputs that may occur in production
environments. Tests ensure that all scoring functions maintain mathematical
consistency and graceful degradation when encountering edge conditions.

The suite focuses on boundary value analysis, negative input handling, and
extreme parameter combinations that could cause algorithm instability or
unexpected behavior in production model evaluation workflows. Critical for
ensuring system reliability across diverse repository conditions.

Edge Case Coverage:
- Parameter boundary conditions and threshold edge cases
- Negative and zero value input handling with graceful degradation
- Extreme quality combinations across all scoring dimensions
- Mathematical consistency validation under stress conditions
- Algorithm stability verification for production reliability

    Validate size scoring algorithm behavior when threshold parameters are invalid.

    Tests the algorithm's handling of edge cases where upper threshold is less than
    or equal to lower threshold, which would create an invalid scoring range. The
    algorithm should gracefully return zero to indicate inability to compute a
    meaningful score rather than causing mathematical errors or exceptions.

    Essential for production robustness when configuration parameters may be
    incorrectly set or when adaptive thresholds create temporary invalid states.
