"""
Comprehensive Scoring Algorithm Validation Tests

This test suite provides exhaustive validation of the weighted scoring system that
combines multiple trustworthiness dimensions into actionable deployment readiness
scores. Tests cover mathematical properties, boundary conditions, and integration
scenarios critical for production model evaluation workflows.

The tests validate score normalization, latency measurement, output completeness,
and mathematical consistency across all scoring dimensions. Essential for ensuring
that composite scores accurately reflect model quality and deployment risk across
enterprise deployment scenarios.

Test Focus Areas:
- Score aggregation and weighting algorithm validation
- Performance timing and latency measurement accuracy
- Boundary condition handling and edge case robustness
- Output format consistency for downstream integration
- Mathematical properties preservation across score combinations

    Validate comprehensive scoring output completeness and format consistency.

    Ensures that the scoring system produces all required metrics with proper
    naming conventions, normalized score ranges, and performance timing data.
    This test is critical for API contract validation and downstream system
    integration that depends on consistent output structure.

    The test verifies:
    - Complete metric coverage across all trustworthiness dimensions
    - Proper score and latency key naming conventions
    - Score normalization within [0,1] range for all metrics
    - Performance timing measurement for system monitoring
