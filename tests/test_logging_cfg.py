Logging Configuration Validation Tests for Production Monitoring

This test suite validates the centralized logging configuration system that supports
production monitoring, debugging, and compliance auditing across all system components.
Tests ensure proper log level management, file handling, and format consistency
required for enterprise operations and troubleshooting workflows.

The logging system supports configurable verbosity levels and file output paths
to accommodate different deployment scenarios from development testing to production
monitoring. Critical for operational visibility and issue diagnosis in enterprise
environments where comprehensive logging is essential for system reliability.

Test Coverage:
- Environment-driven log level configuration and validation
- File path handling with automatic directory creation
- Log format consistency for parsing and analysis tools
- Handler reconfiguration for testing environment compatibility

    Configure centralized logging system with environment-driven verbosity control.

    Establishes production-ready logging infrastructure that adapts to deployment
    environment requirements through environment variables. Supports silent operation
    for production efficiency, informational logging for monitoring, and debug-level
    output for development and troubleshooting scenarios.

    Environment Configuration:
    - LOG_LEVEL=0: Silent operation (CRITICAL+ only) for production
        efficiency
    - LOG_LEVEL=1: Informational logging for operational monitoring
    - LOG_LEVEL=2: Debug logging for development and troubleshooting
    - LOG_FILE: Configurable output path for integration with log management systems

    The system automatically creates log directories and handles handler reconfiguration
    to ensure compatibility with testing frameworks and production deployment scenarios.
